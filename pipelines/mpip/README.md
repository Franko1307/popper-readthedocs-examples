A template showing how to to use Popper in high performance computing 
(HPC) scenarios. A typical experiment in HPC assumes many things from 
the environment: an NFS mount point available in compute nodes, a 
batch scheduler, applications installed/compiled directly on the host 
(i.e. without any type of virtualization), among others. In this case, 
Popper is followed to record the scripts used to compile, install and 
run the experiment, as well as analyze its results.Popper for 
data-driven experiments and analysis. Our wiki contains a more 
[detailed description of this 
template](https://github.com/systemslab/popper/wiki/Popper-HPC).
