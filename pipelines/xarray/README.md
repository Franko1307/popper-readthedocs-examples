# xarray

A template showing how to follow Popper for data-driven experiments 
and analysis. In this case, Popper helps ensure that datasets are 
properly referenced and analysis scripts used to process data (as well 
as any output data) are versioned and associated to an
article. Our wiki contains a more [detailed description of this 
template](https://github.com/systemslab/popper/wiki/Popper-Data-Science).
